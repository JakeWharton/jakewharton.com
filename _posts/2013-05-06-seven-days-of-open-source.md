Square Engineering is celebrating the arrival of Google’s annual [I/O conference](https://developers.google.com/events/io/) here in San Francisco by releasing seven open source projects, all of which are major milestones for us.

Two of the major development platforms in focus at I/O are Android and Java. At Square, we are deeply invested in both of these platforms. As such, all of the releases over the next seven weekdays will be focused on one or both of these great technologies.

In addition to the releases, this blog will feature a new post every day which will provide more information about each project, including our motivation behind it and its use at Square.

Be sure to check back the rest of this week and next for each great release!
