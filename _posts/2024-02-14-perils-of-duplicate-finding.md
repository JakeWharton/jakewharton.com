Given an array of integers (`[1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1]`), find the elements which are duplicated.
No, we're not interviewing.
I'm trying to prevent a user from specifying a reserved value twice.

Elsewhere in the file I already have duplicate detection for object tags.

```kotlin
val dupes: Map<Int, List<Widget>> =
    widgets.groupBy(Widget::tag)
      .filterValues { it.size > 1 }
```

I can do the same technique for the integer array with an identity function and grabbing the resulting keys.

```kotlin
val dupes: Set<Int> =
    ints.groupBy { it }
      .filterValues { it.size > 1 }
      .keys
```

This prints `[1, 3]`.

So… done? Yes!
But no, using the map seems wasteful, right?

### Attempt 1

My first attempt to avoid the map was to remove the set of integers from a list of them.
This should result in a list of any duplicated elements.

```kotlin
val dupes: List<Int> =
    ints.toList() - ints.toSet()
```

No matter the content of `ints`, this will always print `[]`.
Why?

The [`minus` operator](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/minus.html) says that it "returns a list containing all elements of the original collection except the elements contained in the given `elements` collection".
So it removes _all_ occurrences of each element in the set from the list.

This is some surprising behavior to hide behind an operator whose signature operates on an `Iterable` receiver and `Collection` argument.

### Attempt 2

Second attempt switches to `MutableList.removeAll` which takes a collection of elements.
The `MutableList.remove` function only removes the first occurrence of an element, so this should remove the first occurrence of each element in the set.

```kotlin
val dupes: List<Int> =
    ints.toMutableList()
      .apply { removeAll(ints.toSet()) }
```

This once again prints `[]`.
But why?

remove: Removes a single instance of the specified element from this collection, if it is present.
removeAll: Removes all of this collection's elements that are also contained in the specified collection.

Kotlin made me a liar.
`MutableList.remove` does indeed only remove the first occurrence of the element.
`MutableList.removeAll`, however, removes _all_ occurrences of each element in the supplied collection.
That's quite the subtle asymmetry.

There is no function for removing all occurrences of a single element.
Nor a function to remove only the first occurrences of each element of a supplied collection.

You needn't be mad at Kotlin, though.
It [inherited this behavior](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html#removeAll(java.util.Collection)) from Java.

### Attempt 3

Third attempt now with `MutableList.remove`.

```kotlin
val dupes: List<Int> =
    ints.toMutableList()
      .apply { ints.toSet().forEach(::remove) }
```

This (finally) prints `[1, 3, 1]`.
If we want just the set of duplicates to match the map-based approach above we can tag on a `toSet()`.

```kotlin
val dupes: Set<Int> =
    ints.toMutableList()
      .apply { ints.toSet().forEach(::remove) }
      .toSet()
```

Visually this is not the greatest.
It's also not really that efficient (not that we've been worrying about that yet).
We got here because I started with a clever-but-incorrect approach (`toList() - toSet()`) that I then had to refactor until it was correct.

### Attempt 4

Fourth attempt is a chance to reset our approach.
I thought that we could partition the elements based on whether we've seen the value before.
A set tracks the values, and its `MutableSet.add` returns a boolean indicating whether the collection was mutated (i.e., has been seen before).

```kotlin
val dupes: Set<Int> =
    HashSet<Int>()
      .run { ints.partition(::add) }
      .second
      .toSet()
```

This prints `[1, 3]` correctly.
Visually the code is just dreadful.
It's hard to quickly discern what value is flowing from line to line.

Using `partition` was just my first intuition.
But a `partition` that throws away half the result has another name: a `filter`!

### Attempt 5

Fifth attempt at this now using a filter.

```kotlin
val dupes: Set<Int> =
    ints.filterNot(HashSet<Int>()::add)
      .toSet()
```

This continues to print `[1, 3]` correctly.
We use `filterNot` because we want to keep elements where `MutableSet.add` returns _false_.
Visually this is pretty decent.

The use of `HashSet<Int>()::add` is what's known as a _bound_ reference.
We are specifying a function reference of `MutableSet::add` as our `filterNot` lambda, but bound to an instance of `MutableSet` which we are creating on-the-fly.
This is an equivalent version of the above code.

```kotlin
val seen = HashSet<Int>()
val dupes: Set<Int> =
    ints.filterNot(seen::add)
      .toSet()
```

The advantage of inlining the `HashSet` instantiation is that we don't need to name it.[^1]

[^1]: As I'm writing this I'm realizing the `partition` above could have been `ints.partition(HashSet<Int>::add).second.toSet()`. This produces the same bytecode, but from a more compact Kotlin.

### Attempt 5.1

Finally, almost all of Kotlin's collection extensions have `To`-suffixed variants which allow supplying a destination collection.
This can save you from having to add a `toSomething()` after an operation by instead just using that `Something` in the operation directly.

```kotlin
val dupes: Set<Int> =
    ints.filterNotTo(HashSet(), HashSet<Int>::add)
```

Pretty, pretty, pretty good.

### Benchmarks

Performance is not really a concern in my usage, but let's look anyway.

```
Benchmark                                       Score      Error   Units
----------------------------------------------  ---------  ------  -----
IntDupes.map                                     94.015 ±   0.469  ns/op
IntDupes.map:·gc.alloc.rate.norm                776.000 ±   0.001   B/op

IntDupes.mutableListRemove                      155.744 ±  17.829  ns/op
IntDupes.mutableListRemove:·gc.alloc.rate.norm  560.000 ±   0.001   B/op

IntDupes.partition                              135.693 ±  18.976  ns/op
IntDupes.partition:·gc.alloc.rate.norm          544.000 ±   0.001   B/op

IntDupes.filterNot                               97.748 ±   1.055  ns/op
IntDupes.filterNot:·gc.alloc.rate.norm          504.000 ±   0.001   B/op

IntDupes.filterNotTo                             39.904 ±   0.331  ns/op
IntDupes.filterNotTo:·gc.alloc.rate.norm        432.000 ±   0.001   B/op
```

So the `filterNotTo` winds up being the fastest and allocates the fewest bytes.
Double win!
