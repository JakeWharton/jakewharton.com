title: Java Library Desugaring
---

Library desugaring is a new feature of the Android Gradle plugin which makes APIs like streams, optional, and java.time available on older API levels. While simple in concept, the implementation is surprisingly complex. This talk will investigate the challenges of library desugaring, compare and contrast it against standalone alternatives like ThreeTenBP and StreamSupport, and finally detail how to use it effectively in libraries and applications.
