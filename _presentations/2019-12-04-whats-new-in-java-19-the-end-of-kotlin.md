Kotlin's introduction was a breath of fresh air at a time when the pace of innovation in Java felt glacial. Since that time, development of Java has rapidly increased with an emphasis on fixing the pain points of the language and the efficiency of data representation in the VM. Will Kotlin still have a place in the JVM language ecosystem in a few years?

This talk will compare and contrast how the two languages approach solving the same problems of today's Java. We'll look at data-carrying types, asynchronous programming, nullability, and more. For some of these, we'll also see how one language sometimes influenced the other. Finally, we'll peer a few years into the future to see where both languages are headed and determine whether we still need a Kotlin (spoiler: we probably do!).
