Metaprogramming is all around us on Android in the form of reflection, annotation processing, Gradle plugins, and standalone tools. Some of the most popular and widespread libraries in use leverage one or more of these facilities. But none of these are the perfect tool for every problem. Each has advantages and disadvantages depending on how they’re used. And choosing the wrong one can actually harm the usability of your library.

This talk will compare and contrast the different approaches to metaprogramming, look at popular Android libraries and evaluate whether they made the right choice, and conclude with recommendations for those looking to use these techniques in the future.
