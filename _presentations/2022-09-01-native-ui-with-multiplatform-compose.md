Compose is a delightful way to build UI in Kotlin, but Compose UI doesn't always make sense (or exist) on platforms like the web and iOS. React Native uses the native UI toolkit of each platform, but requires JavaScript and is always chasing compatibility with each platform's new features.

Redwood is a new tool from Cash App which lets you keep writing Kotlin and Compose but target the native UI toolkit of each platform.

This session will introduce Redwood by:
- Comparing and contrasting it with other cross-platform tools
- Demonstrate its differentiating features in samples and production usage
- Document the internal architecture of how it works
- Using it to update screens outside of the app store process
