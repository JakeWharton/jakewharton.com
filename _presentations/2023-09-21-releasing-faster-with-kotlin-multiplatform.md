title: "Releasing faster with Kotlin multiplatform"
---

In this talk, we discuss some new libraries and tools being used at Cash App to get faster feedback cycles for developers and release to users in hours instead of days. This is all built on Kotlin multiplatform and combines the best features of the web and native applications. It’s not a silver bullet, but an evolution of various techniques to try to solve some of mobile development’s biggest pain points.

We will cover:

 * The history of the problem from the perspective of both our developers and the needs of the product.
 * What is Kotlin Multiplatform and why did we choose it?
 * Two open source libraries we built to make this possible: Redwood and Zipline.
 * A demo of the technology in action and its real-world usage within Cash App.
